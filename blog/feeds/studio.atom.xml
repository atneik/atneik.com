&lt;p&gt;Most of us use Internet to learn new things, and learning new exercises is done in a similar manner. But, the problem is that, it’s quite difficult to find an exercise on a smartphone and then use it to follow the exercise while at a Gym. Now imagine this for every exercise. Now this is where a smartwatch comes into picture, which can show animations of the exercise and also guide through the routine while being non intrusive. Watch can also help users keep track of resting time between two exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there is no way to record actual exercises done during a Gym session (except of course self logging, which has way too much friction). This two-device system can record history and then provide long-term benefits by showing visualizations of overall health on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Considerations &amp;amp; Constrains&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to sync: The interplay between the watch and a phone can easily become a headache and hard to understand. The phone application provides a single large button ‘Start’ when the routine is set to go. Upon pressing the button the routine is uploaded to the watch and a message is shown on both the devices. Here it assumes that the devices are already paired using Bluetooth or similar technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not bombard user with options: The interaction promotes the user to follow the most common case and make things less complicated for an average user. Earlier versions of the application scheduled the routine weekly rather than just in time. This was making the system complicated and time intensive. Therefore, it was striped down to only create instant routines and upload it to the watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the limited watch screen space efficiently: The main utility of the application is to show the animations of exercises. This needs space. So, sole focus was given to the animation with only a single button to inform termination of the exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fulfils current goal of the user: During user testing it became evident that users might not create schedules for a weeklong gym routine and rather create them on the fly. So, the system focused on users’ current goal of quickly manipulating the routine and uploading it to the watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides short-term and long-term value: Short-term goals are met by delivering animations so that user correctly performs the exercise. Also the Watch helps user on track by clearly showing the flow of the routine from resting time to &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Functionality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create instant Gym routines on phone by combining numerous Exercises.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer routine form the phone to the watch. Transfer actually completed exercises from the watch to the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help user follow the routines (created on phone) using the watch with appropriate exercise animations and rest time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize history of exercises done, calories burned, etc. according to week, month and year on the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did three revisions of the design. Before achieving any fidelity, I first simulated the complete interaction using plain white cards. Within an hour, this activity revealed major flow problems in the design. It also gave me an idea what kind of interfacing elements would be needed to create the experience I have in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting screen (when there is no routine) shows weekdays. The user is supposed to select a day and then add exercises to that particular day. This created the complete weekly schedule of the workout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One the prime feature I wanted was an intuitive Timeline to represent the Routine in a form of a Scroll wherein users can easily edit the exercise by sliding them off to delete and adding them using a ‘+’ button. To give a proper experience of a scroll I created a phone using cardboard and made two slits, one at the top and other at bottom, so as to make paper slide through vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To select the exercise to be added to the routine, I created a checked list that the user could scroll and check the exercises he/she wanted in the routine, and then finally tap on done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After addition of exercises the routine is ready to be uploaded to the watch. The upload is automatically done by tapping on ‘Start’ button. This shows a message ‘Your watch is ready is go’ on the phone. While simultaneously, the watch shows ready to Go!’. Now, tapping on ‘Go!’ begins the routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the watch side, it was simple and functional so as to better use the small screen. The watch that I prototyped was actually two times the scale of the original conception. This was to better support the interaction and the ease of creating. Now as the user tapped on ‘Go!’, the routine begins in the watch. The watch displays animations of the exercise and resting time in the same order the user specified in the routine. The watch at the end uploads the exercises (which user actually completed) to the phone to be archived in the history for future analysis. The watch also vibrates to alert the user at the end of each rest time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second version was used for user testing. The tester was a Gym goer so could relate more to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally when the workout is finished the user can check his/her history of adherence to the routine. For this, the phone app shows charts/visualizations, according to week, month and year. These visualizations focus upon ‘How much user follows the routine?’, ‘Calories burned over the period?’, etc. All this data is possible as the watch syncs back the actual completed exercises to the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After user testing and analysis I came up with the third version, which further improved some aspects of the prototype. The next section deals with analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem with the application was that, the application was difficult to grasp on the first usage. This was majorly due to weekly schedule instead of one single routine that the user can upload to the watch. To improve this, the application was simplified by just presenting a single routine instead every day of the week. Below is the new first screen of the application (if no routines). Upon addition of exercises the bottom button shows Start (as shown in above images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another improvement was on the watch interface, wherein the status of the exercises was missing. The information about how many exercises are done and how many are left were not shown in the earlier version. This was elegantly implemented by showing a status bar on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion &amp;amp; Critiques&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the testers and many other students appreciated the scroll functionality. Earlier versions had complains about being complex. This was due to considering weekly schedule instead of focusing upon current user needs. This was improvised in the third version of the application by uploading present-day routine rather than on weekly schedules. The complexity was further reduced by not showing all connection stages/states between the phone and the watch. It was assumed that both the devices are connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final version of the application worked well. It was self-explanatory and users spend less time figuring out the usage. The interaction was predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short 60-sec video of user testing was commended for editing and background sound, but it was regarded too fast to be able to concentrate on the interaction flow of the application (I 2xed it to show the complete interaction in 60-secs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W2/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="prototyping"></category></entry><entry><title>Paper Prototyping a Coffee Shop App</title><link href="http://blog.atneik.com/paper-prototyping-coffee-shop-app.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-13T10:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Aniket Handa</name></author><id>tag:blog.atneik.com,2014-01-13:paper-prototyping-coffee-shop-app.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This quarter is going to be exciting! As the Studio deals with the most waited phase of the process i.e. Prototyping. We start the first studio session by paper prototyping an Tablet App for ordering coffee at a Cafe. The project was narrowed to include only three kinds of coffee (Espresso, Macchiato and Cappuccino) coming in three different sizes. So, a total of nine offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W1/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussing the minimum requirements of the application; me and other team members started individually designing the layout and flow of the coffee application. We laid down some evaluation criterion using which we may evaluate our design. One of the most important ones being: &lt;em&gt;quickness&lt;/em&gt; (said frequently in the &lt;a href="http://blogs.uw.edu/hcid521/exercises#e1"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;) or most less number of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used small white cards to draw the rough layout of the UI. Separate card for each manipulation possible helped me rapidly analyze and alter the flow of the interaction. In a relatively short time, I was able to discern that a single frame was enough to show all the desired information without back and forth between more frames. Dynamically changing the parameters and showing the final cost on same frame eliminated the need of more frames. Hence, making it a bit faster. This might have been possible due to low number of offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others came with, a nice top down layout of the elements (coffee on top and billing on bottom right) coherent with the visual flow followed by a typical user, and also with a robust way to represent billing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then combined the best of our individual work to generate a single frame ready to be user tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W1/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of user testing, the weaker sections of the design were clearly evident. First, was the ambiguous ‘Add’ button. Users clicked it add the order and got the feedback by lower half being updated. The problem was, how to remove an order? It wasn’t obvious. The other problem was the redundant billing information which was visually present on the upper half and numerically present in the lower half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve these issues, we dropped the ‘Add’ button. And now any changes on the top updated the bill automatically. We provided feedback using text (like a &lt;em&gt;toast&lt;/em&gt; in Android OS). For the other issue we got rid of redundancy and now only showed cumulative sum of each kind of coffee along with total amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23289062/siteImages/Studio/Q2/W1/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the flow improve tremendously. The user was now able to manipulate (increase or decrease) the total number of each offering needed in just two clicks. And then all that was required was to click on ‘Submit’ after reviewing the total amount. Adding tip was made easy by just tapping on some pre-calculated tipping percentages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial user testing are crucial. They reveal the most fundamental problems with the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the most common case the fastest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show feedback and status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something is not clickable, blend it into the background. (here the coffee cups had a yellow background due to Post-it, so some users thought them as a Button)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictability over Smartness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of all possible scenarios and permutations to break the system. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than discussing in a team, try A/B testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterations. Iterations. Iterations. (rapid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this good/bad for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper prototyping is a great way to quickly put down the ideas not only to test but also to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember not to put great efforts in visual aesthetics esp. initially. Its a fast and dirty way to fail ideas to move towards the quality ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might not work for all kind of interfaces, such as 3D interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even in touch interfaces it might not give the same experience for certain gesture based input methods such as swipe, slide, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
